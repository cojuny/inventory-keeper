an item is a defined stock item (id count starts from 100000)

a ledger consists of multiple transction (id count starts from 200000)
each ledger has two state (is_applied = {True, False})
    unapplied ledger:
        can modify
        add or delete transaction
        delete the entire ledger
    applied ledger:
        cannot modify the transaction
        cannot delete the entire ledger
each row is a transaction, containing following information
    item ID (auto fill)
    item name (select)
    transaction_type (stock in / stock out)
    unit
    total cost / price (auto fill)

    Remarks/Notes




a transaction is a row record of change in item quantity, either (transaction_type={"stock-in", "stock-out"}) (id count starts from 300000)
transaction is only created when a ledger is applied
transaction should associated with a ledger and an item, relational db

the income is the sum of all stock-out transactions' quantity multiplied by the item unit price
the expense is the sum of all stock-in transctions' quantity multiplied by the item unit cost

the user(manager) can:
    # add item (the initial quantity will not be a part of expense)
    # view item and the balance
    # delete item (the balance quantity will not be a part of income)
    # create ledger from brand new
    # view an old ledger
    # modify an old ledger (if unapplied)
    # delete an old ledger (if unapplied)
    # apply a ledger

to-do list:
    set buttons for navigations (Daniel only implemented the navigation by url)
    render income and expense dashboard
    implement dashboard by different time period
    set warning if stock is low
    Front (I think it is good enough (Daniel's opinion))
